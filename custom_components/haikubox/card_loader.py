"""Startup loader for the Haikubox cards (see www/haikubox-card-loader.js).

add_extra_js_url alone isn't enough: HA serves index.html before stage-2
integrations set up, bakes the extra-module list into it at render time, and
never loads modules added afterwards. A page loaded during startup — which is
when a reconnecting browser or Companion app reloads — gets no card JS, and
every Haikubox card stays a "Custom element doesn't exist" error.

The fix is to have something in the page from the first render that is served
from the first request:
  * The loader file is copied to config/www, served at /local — mounted by the
    frontend integration before the web server starts, unlike our own static
    path, which only exists once our async_setup has run.
  * It's registered as a Lovelace resource, which is persisted in .storage and
    so is listed for the page even during startup.
The loader then retries the real card imports until our static path is up.

Resources only exist in storage mode; YAML-mode dashboards still get the cards
via add_extra_js_url but must list the loader themselves to cover startup.
