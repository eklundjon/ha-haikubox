"""Lovelace resources for the cards, so a page loaded during startup gets them.

add_extra_js_url only reaches pages rendered after async_setup has run, but HA
serves the frontend from bootstrap stage 0, long before custom integrations
load. The frontend reloads itself when it sees a new backend version, so after
every HA update a kiosk or wall tablet reloads in that gap, gets an index.html
without the cards, and shows "Custom element doesn't exist" until someone
refreshes it.

Lovelace's resource list is stored by HA itself and is there from the first
request, so a resource for each card gets it requested on that page too. Our
static path isn't registered yet at that point, but the card files are served
with a month-long max-age, so a browser that has shown the cards before loads
them from its cache. Lovelace's error card waits for the element to be defined
and rebuilds itself, so nothing else is needed.

Each resource carries the same ?v= URL as the extra-JS entry, so a page that
has both still runs one copy of each module.
