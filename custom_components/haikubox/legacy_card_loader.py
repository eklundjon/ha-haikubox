"""Cleanup for the /local card loader that 0.9.0 through 1.0.0-rc1 installed.

Those versions copied haikubox-card-loader.js into config/www and registered
/local/haikubox-card-loader.js as a Lovelace resource, so the cards would also
load on pages opened while HA was still starting. An integration shouldn't
write into the user's www folder: the copy outlives an uninstall, and
everything under /local is served without authentication. The cards now
handle HA's scoped registry polyfill themselves (see _defineElement in the
card modules), and this removes what the older versions left behind.
