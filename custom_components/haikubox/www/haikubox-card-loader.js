// Startup loader for the Haikubox cards.
//
// Why this exists: the integration injects the card modules with
// add_extra_js_url, which HA bakes into index.html at page-render time. HA's
// web server comes up (and serves index.html) before stage-2 integrations like
// this one have set up, and the frontend never loads extra modules added after
// the page was rendered. A page loaded in that window — which is exactly when
// a browser or Companion app reconnecting after a restart reloads — gets no
// card JS, and every Haikubox card stays a "Custom element doesn't exist"
// error until a manual refresh.
//
// This file is copied into config/www and registered as a Lovelace resource,
// so it's served from /local (mounted before the web server starts) and listed
// in the page from the first render. It imports the real card modules from
// the integration's own static path, retrying until that path is registered.
// Once the element is defined, Lovelace rebuilds any error cards on its own.
//
// The integration version rides in on this file's ?v= query (the resource URL)
// and is forwarded to the card URLs, so they match the add_extra_js_url URLs
// exactly — the browser's module map then normally runs each card module only
// once no matter which path loads it first.
//
// The one exception is browsers without native scoped custom element
// registries (e.g. WebKit before iPadOS/Safari 26), where HA's app bundle
// installs a polyfill that replaces window.customElements. index.html starts
// the app bundle and the add_extra_js_url modules in parallel; if a card
// module wins, it defines its element on the native registry, which the
// polyfill's get()/whenDefined() can't see — so Lovelace never finds the card,
// on every reload. Importing the same URL again is a no-op (the module has
// already run), so a resolved import only counts once the tag is visible on
// the current registry; otherwise the retry path re-runs the module under a
// fresh URL, which defines it on the polyfilled registry.

// Keep in sync with _CARDS in __init__.py: [custom element tag, module URL].
